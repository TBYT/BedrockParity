# Geyser Parity
Spigot Plugin for GeyserMC Servers that bridges the Parity between bedrock and java exclusive features.

Parity Fixes:
- https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1741 by adding the sweeping edge level to the lore of the item. Also sweeping edge now works in the anvil because this fix adds unbreaking 1 to the 2nd slot in the anvil if that slot contains a sweeping edge only book.
