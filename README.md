# Geyser Parity
Spigot Plugin for GeyserMC Servers that bridges the Parity between bedrock and java exclusive features.
Developing based off my personal needs. Please go ahead and fork to contribute to bring parity between the platforms.


# Parity Fixes:
Sweeping edge now works in the anvil because this fix adds unbreaking 1 to the second slot in the anvil if that slot contains a sweeping edge only book.


# Outdated Solutions:
- Fixed https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/issues/1741 by adding the sweeping edge level to the lore of the item. 
- - This https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/pull/3615 fixed this issue and implements it better than I did.

# Disclaimer: 
This Repository used https://github.com/GeyserMC/Hurricane as a base to contribute my fixes; ie sweeping edge. I recommend using this plugin as well.
